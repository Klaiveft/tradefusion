NEWS_API_KEY=your_news_key
```
### Use of Generative AI Tools

During the development of TradeFusion, I utilized ChatGPT (GPT-5) as a collaborative assistant throughout the design, coding, and optimization phases.
The AI contributed to several key aspects of the project:

Interface design: The AI was used to co-design the modern dark-mode interface using TailwindCSS and to integrate ApexCharts for dynamic sparkline visualizations.

Prompt engineering and documentation: ChatGPT was employed to draft concise technical documentation.

Environment and deployment setup:
It provided secure patterns for managing API keys via .env and python-dotenv, and guidance for local versus cloud deployment using uvicorn.

_The AIâ€™s role was assistive, not generative - all source code was manually verified, integrated, and tested. This collaborative process accelerated development, reduced debugging time, and ensured best practices for performance and security._
